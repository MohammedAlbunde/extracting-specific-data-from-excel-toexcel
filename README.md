# extracting-specific-data-from-excel-toexcel
Excel file represents database for motors (PN,SN, and readings ), this code will ask user about desired information  and extract these info to another excel file.
Hello Gitters,
This python code is built to meet a need in my job, the need was we have an excel file represents results for many motors, each motor has its own sheet named as the part number.
In that sheet we have many serial numbers, each serial number has many readings.
Code will ask user about these info he/she wants to extract to a seperated excel file for that specific P/N.
